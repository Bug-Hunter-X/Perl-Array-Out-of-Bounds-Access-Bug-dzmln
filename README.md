This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The bug can lead to unexpected results, including segmentation faults or incorrect data manipulation.  The solution emphasizes the importance of bounds checking before array access.
